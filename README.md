Welcome to my repository! Here, I showcase some of my projects that demonstrate my skills and interests in the field of programming. Due to copyright considerations, I do not provide access to projects I am currently actively working on.

## My Personal Projects

1. "Ninja: Ascension" - One of my most inspiring endeavors is the realization of a childhood dream. Like many of us, in my early years, I was an avid fan of the anime "Naruto." Enthralled by the prospect of leaping through trees, battling foes, and the sensation of hidden power, I yearned to play a game where these elements were part of an exhilarating virtual world. Over time and with accumulated experience in game development, I made the decision to turn my long-held dream into reality. The outcome of this determination is the project "Ninja: Ascension."

## Game Development

I have had the opportunity to contribute as a programmer in the development of various games. Below are some of the projects where I've applied my programming skills to create engaging gaming experiences.

1. **Flex Strike**
   One of my favorite games that I developed. I was the initiator of this project. Google Play link - [Flex Strike on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Pixapp.FlexStrike)

2. **Shoot Him**
   This game was developed in just one week. An express project that showcases my ability to work efficiently within tight deadlines. Google Play link - [Shoot Him on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PixApp.ShootHim)

3. **Little Forest Adventure**
   This game underwent several reimaginings before we achieved the desired result. The development took about a month. Google Play link - [Little Forest Adventure on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PixappGames.LittleForestAdvanture)

4. **Bowling Jump**
   A game created on the fly. Although I personally am not a fan, it is also part of my portfolio. Google Play link - [Bowling Jump on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Pixapp.BowlingJump)

5. **Magic Him**
   This project was inspired by an artistic concept and was supposed to feature more interesting mechanics with successful CPI metrics. Unfortunately, the CPI results turned out to be unsatisfactory.

6. **Boxing Way**
   Another express project that, in my opinion, turned out quite amusing. Google Play link - [Boxing Way on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Pixapp.PunchHim)

7. **Brick Break**
   This was one of my first 2D games in which I participated in the development. Google Play link - [Brick Break on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Pixapp.BrickBreak)

   Another game created on the fly. Google Play link - [Iron Tube on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Pixapp.IronTube)

9. **Red Ball: Secret Adventure**
   This project took us about 3-4 months of development. It was our effort on a Red Ball 4 clone. Google Play link - [Red Ball: Secret Adventure on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herocraft.game.free.red.hero.ball.bounce.jump)
